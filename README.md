#Report:

#   Capomulin is an affective treatment based on the data collected.
#   Capomulin has the largest number of data points in this study to back up its validity 
#   On our sample subject, we can see as time increases the size of the tumour decrease resulting in an inverse relationship implying that the treatment was having a positive affect on reducing the size of the tumour.
#   The weight of the mouse and size of tumour appears correlated. With a correlation coefficient of 0.83 we can conclude a good to strong positive correlation between these two metrics.
#   To further this analysis, I would next calculate the delta of the tumour volume from lowest to highest timepoints and then compared for each mouse with then the abilities to compare against different treatments.


#Note - I naturally attempted to build the data for the box and whisker plot in alternative way then how the homework instructed. This is included in the jupyter notebook file. However, after constructing the data by how we were asked to in the homework, I immediately saw the benefit. As its constructed over iterations and conditional statements, if ever in the future I want to output a box and whisker plot on another set of drugs, I simply update the names in my treatments list and the code does the rest, less code and more future proof.
